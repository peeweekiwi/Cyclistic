# Cyclistic Bike_Share User Analysis by R

## **Introduction**

This case study is a capstone project for my [Google Data Analyst Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/4PMCRU98UADD). In this project, I employed data wrangling, analytical, and visualization skills to address a marketing problem for Cyclistic, a fictional bike share company in Chicago. 
<br>
Cyclistic has concluded that the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, the marketing team aims to convert more casial riders into members. The main goal of this project is to answer the question: **How do annual subscribers and casual customers use Cyclistic bikes differently?** From my insights, the marketing team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
